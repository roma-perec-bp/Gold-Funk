This is the another fork of Psych Engine 1.0.4 but this one has more than other forks (i guess)
Welp for now it doesnt but current target is making custom sofcode states and edit other states like Freeplay, MainMenu, etc.

Parts of engine was used in mods like:

[Brutal Pizdec Impotence DLC](https://gamebanana.com/mods/573827)

[That Song Again](https://gamebanana.com/mods/580609)

[I Hate This Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/582655)

## Installation:

Refer to [the Build Instructions](/docs/BUILDING.md)

## Customization:

If you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*, you can refer to the `Project.xml` file.

Inside `Project.xml`, you will find several variables to customize Psych Engine to your liking.

To start you off, disabling *Video Cutscenes* should be simple, simply delete the line `"VIDEOS_ALLOWED"` or comment it out by wrapping the line in XML-like comments, like this: `<!-- YOUR_LINE_HERE -->`

Same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.xml` file.

## Softcoding (.lua/.hx)
For this you can head over to [the wiki](https://shadowmario.github.io/psychengine.lua)

There you can learn how to use the 212 PlayState funcions in your mod!

## Cool new Chart Editor changes and countless bug fixes
![Chart Editor](docs/img/chart.png)
* You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with five example types:
  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
  * Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.
  * Hurt Notes: If Boyfriend hits this note, he plays a miss animation and loses some health.
  * GF Sing: Rather than the character hitting the note and singing, Girlfriend sings instead.
  * No Animation: Character just hits the note, no animation plays.

## Multiple editors to assist you in making your own Mod
![Master Editor Menu](docs/img/editors.png)
* Working both for Source code modding and Downloaded builds!

## Story mode menu rework:
![Story Mode Menu](docs/img/storymode.png)
* Added a different BG to every song (less Tutorial)
* All menu characters are now in individual spritesheets, makes modding it easier.

## Credits menu
![Credits Menu](docs/img/credits.png)
* You can add a head icon, name, description and a Redirect link for when the player presses Enter while the item is currently selected.

## Awards/Achievements
* The engine comes with 16 example achievements that you can mess with and learn how it works (Check Achievements.hx and search for "checkForAchievement" on PlayState.hx)
![Achievements](docs/img/Achievements.png)

## Options menu:
* You can change Note colors, Delay and Combo Offset, Controls and Preferences there.
 * On Preferences you can toggle Downscroll, Middlescroll, Anti-Aliasing, Framerate, Low Quality, Note Splashes, Flashing Lights, etc.
![Options](docs/img/Options.png)

## Other gameplay features:
* When the enemy hits a note, their strum note also glows.
* Lag doesn't impact the camera movement and player icon scaling anymore.
* Some stuff based on Week 7's changes has been put in (Background colors on Freeplay, Note splashes)
* You can reset your Score on Freeplay/Story Mode by pressing Reset button.
* You can listen to a song or adjust Scroll Speed/Damage taken/etc. on Freeplay by pressing Space.
* You can enable "Combo Stacking" in Gameplay Options. This causes the combo sprites to just be one sprite with an animation rather than sprites spawning each note hit.
