<h1 align='center'>Gold Funk'!</h1>

This is the another fork of Psych Engine 1.0.4 but this one has more than other forks (i guess)
Welp for now it doesnt but current target is making custom softcode states and edit other states like Freeplay, MainMenu, etc.

Parts of engine was used in mods like:

[Brutal Pizdec Impotence DLC](https://gamebanana.com/mods/573827)

[That Song Again](https://gamebanana.com/mods/580609)

[I Hate This Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/582655)

## Installation:

Refer to [the Build Instructions](/docs/BUILDING.md)

## Customization:

If you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*, you can refer to the `Project.xml` file.

Inside `Project.xml`, you will find several variables to customize Psych Engine to your liking.

To start you off, disabling *Video Cutscenes* should be simple, simply delete the line `"VIDEOS_ALLOWED"` or comment it out by wrapping the line in XML-like comments, like this: `<!-- YOUR_LINE_HERE -->`

Same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.xml` file.
